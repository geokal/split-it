# Ona Analysis Reports

This folder contains analysis reports generated by Ona, the AI software engineering agent.

## Reports

### 1. [CODEBASE_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](./CODEBASE_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)
Complete architectural analysis of the Split-It (AcademyHub) codebase including:
- Technology stack overview
- Architecture patterns (Service Layer, Component Organization, Data Layer)
- Entry points and configuration
- Critical patterns and conventions
- Getting started guide

**Key Insights:**
- .NET 8 Blazor Server application with Auth0 authentication
- Service-oriented architecture with DbContextFactory pattern
- Role-based component organization (Student, Company, Professor, ResearchGroup, Admin)
- 60+ EF Core entities with SQL Server backend

### 2. [UI_FRAMEWORK_COUPLING_ANALYSIS.md](./UI_FRAMEWORK_COUPLING_ANALYSIS.md)
Detailed assessment of UI framework coupling and component splitting recommendations:
- Component size analysis (78,094 total lines of Razor markup)
- Bootstrap 5 dependency assessment
- Refactoring strategy with 4 phases
- Implementation roadmap (8-10 weeks)
- Migration path examples

**Key Findings:**
- ❌ **URGENT**: Components need splitting before UI framework migration
- ❌ 2,000+ line components with hard-coded Bootstrap classes
- ✅ Recommended: Create UI primitives library + split large components
- ✅ Estimated effort: 360 hours over 8-10 weeks

## Purpose

These reports provide:
1. **Onboarding**: Help new developers understand the codebase structure
2. **Planning**: Inform refactoring and migration decisions
3. **Documentation**: Capture architectural decisions and patterns
4. **Risk Assessment**: Identify technical debt and maintenance challenges

## Generated
